# Hybrid CNN-ViT-MLP Face Recognition

A hybrid deep learning model combining CNN (ResNet-50), Vision Transformers (ViT), and MLP to enhance facial recognition performance in terms of accuracy, robustness, and efficiency.

## Features
- Local feature extraction using CNN (ResNet-50)
- Global context via Vision Transformers
- Final classification using MLP
- Improved recognition under occlusion and lighting variation

## Model Architecture
1. **CNN Backbone**: Extracts spatial facial features.
2. **Vision Transformer**: Captures long-range dependencies.
3. **MLP Classifier**: Performs identity classification.

## Dataset and Evaluation
- Trained and evaluated on large-scale facial datasets.
- Outperforms standalone models like FaceNet, ResNet-50, and pure ViTs.

## How to Use
Upload the notebook to your Colab environment or run it locally with the required dependencies (`torch`, `transformers`, `tensorflow`, etc.).
